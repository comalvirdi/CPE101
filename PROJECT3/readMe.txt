# Project 3
# 
# Name: Comal Virdi and Mary McCafferty
# Instructor: S. Einakian
# Section: 01


For this project we both spent time planning out the functions. Individually, Mary wrote the functions that grab the input from the user, and Comal wrote the functions that find the words forward, backward, up and down. Together, we wrote the functions that manipulate the lists so that they can be run through the finder functions.

We also spent time together running the tests and debugging the code.
